#			!! IMPORTANT !!

# Makefile.in is the template used to produce the Makefile for the examples.
# Makefile.in is processed when you run configure.  Variables bracketed by `@'
# characters, e.g., @EXEEXT@, will be replaced with a value that is correct for
# your specific installation and the choices you make when running configure.

# If you write your own main program, or need to customise the Makefile for
# some other reason, modify Makefile.in, not Makefile! Makefile is regenerated
# every time you run configure, and your changes will be lost. If you don't see
# variables like @EXEEXT@ below, you're looking at Makefile. You want
# Makefile.in.

# For those familiar with GNU autotools, who are asking ``What about
# Makefile.am?'', stop looking. Makefile.in is the starting point in example
# directories in a COIN distribution. Knowledge of make is all that's required
# to work with Makefile.in, a more reasonable assumption for most users.
##########################################################################

# Blocks prefixed with CHANGEME will probably need some adjustment if you write
# a custom main program.

# As distributed, this makefile will build two sample main programs:
#  * osi_dylp is a bare C driver for dylp; it makes no use of COIN software
#  * odsi+dylp is a driver to exercise dylp via the OsiDylp OSI layer; it
#    uses dylp as you should use it in the context of COIN.
# Have a look at the README for more information about each of them.
#
# If you're customising this file for your own code, choose one of DRIVER_CXX
# or DRIVER_C based on whether the main program is C or C++. The remainder of
# the source files can be any mix of C or C++. (Adding other languages to the
# mix will probably require more extensive modifications.)

# CHANGEME: The name of your main program.

DRIVER_CXX = odsi+dylp
DRIVER_C = osi_dylp

# CHANGEME: This should be the name of your executable. You won't need to edit
# these lines unless you want the final executable to have a name that's
# different from the name you gave for DRIVER_CXX / DRIVER_C just above.

EXE_CXX = $(DRIVER_CXX)@EXEEXT@
EXE_C = $(DRIVER_C)@EXEEXT@

# CHANGEME: OBJS* should specify the files required to build the executable.

OBJS_CXX =  $(DRIVER_CXX).@OBJEXT@

OBJS_C = $(DRIVER_C).@OBJEXT@ \

# build.
