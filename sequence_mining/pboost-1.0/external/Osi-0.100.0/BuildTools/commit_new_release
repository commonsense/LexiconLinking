# this call is to allow us to easily obtain the current revision. It might be
# useful to strengthen this and check that the value is what we're expecting
# --- one greater than the revision before commit. `--ignore-externals' could
# be made provisional on the existence of circular dependency by passing a
# boolean through .new_release_data. This would strengthen the update, in that
# the update would confirm existence of the externals.
